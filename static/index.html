        <p>Temporary hosting for static websites.</p>
        <p>
            You can create a hosted website simply by uploading a zip or tar file
            containing your site via a HTTP POST. The below curl command will do
            just that:
        </p>
        <center>
            <code>
            curl --data-binary @website.zip https://tmpweb.net
        </code>
        </center>
        <p>The response will be the URL at which your website will be hosted for
            the next seven days.</p>
        <p>The source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/Fraetor/tmpweb.net">GitHub</a>.</p>
