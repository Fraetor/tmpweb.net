        <p>Temporary hosting for static websites, usable programmatically.</p>
        <p>
            With this service you can create a hosted website simply by
            uploading a zip or tar file containing your site (up to 50 MiB) via
            a HTTP POST. The below curl command will do just that:
        </p>
        <center>
            <code>
            curl --data-binary @website.zip https://tmpweb.net
        </code>
        </center>
        <p>The server will respond with the URL at which your website will be
            hosted for the next seven days.</p>
        <p>/tmp/web.net is intended to aid in sharing generated HTML reports and
            design prototypes.</p>
